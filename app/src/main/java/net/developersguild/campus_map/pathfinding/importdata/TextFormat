#Comments may be placed on any line and end at the next newline
#First, specify the bounds of the area. For example:
0 1 0 1
#specifies the map to accept points between 0 and 1 in both X and Y.
#
#Next, specify nodes and their connections.
#The format is "name latitude longitude connection:description:reverseDescription". The last part,
#   connection:description:reverseDescription, should be repeated once for each desired connection.
#
#connection is the name of a node to connect to. If it begins with ">", it is a destination node and
#   will be searchable (the ">" will be removed and "_" will be expanded to " ", and that name will
#   be added to the list of searchable destinations). Nodes may not be connected to until they are
#   created on a line of their own.
#description is the human-readable description of the path from the current node to the node named
#   connection.
#reverseDescription is the human-readable description of the path from the node named connection to
#   the current node.
#
#description or reverseDescription should be "/" if the connection is one-way, reverse or forward
#   respectively.
#
#If you use "=" as the reverseDescription, it will be filled in by copying description and inverting
#   "north", "south", "east" and "west" where they appear in lower case.
#
#For example:
