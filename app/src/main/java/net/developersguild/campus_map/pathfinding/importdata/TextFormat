#First, specify the bounds of the area. For example:
0 1 0 1
#specifies the map to accept points between 0 and 1 in both X and Y.
#
#Next, specify nodes and their connections.
#The format is "name latitude longitude connection:description:reverseDescription". The last part,
#   connection:description:reverseDescription, should be repeated once for each desired connection.
#
#connection is the name of a node to connect to. If it begins with ">", it is a destination node and
#   will be searchable (the ">" will be removed and "_" will be expanded to " ", and that name will
#   be added to the list of searchable destinations).
#description is the human-readable description of the path from the current node to the node named
#   connection.
#reverseDescription is the human-readable description of the path from the node named connection to
#   the current node.
#
#
#description or reverseDescription should be "/" if the connection is one-way reverse or forward,
# respectively.
#
#If you use "=" as the reverseDescription, it will be filled in by copying description and inverting
#   "north", "south", "east" and "west" where they appear in lower case.
#
#For example:
>My_House 0.1 0.2
>Office_Center 0.2 0.2 myHouse:Walk_north_along_Main_Street:=
>Food_Mart 0.1 0.3 myHouse:Go_through_the_one-way_gate:/ office:/:Go_through_the_one-way_gate
